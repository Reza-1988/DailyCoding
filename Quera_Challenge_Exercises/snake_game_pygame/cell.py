# This module defines the Cell class.
# Each square (cell) of the game board is represented by a Cell instance.
# The *type* of a cell (empty, fruit, snake, blocked) is inferred from its color.

class Cell:
    def __init__(self, surface, sx, sy, color=consts.back_color):
        """
        Initialize a single board cell and draw it on the given surface.

        Args:
            surface (pygame.Surface): The surface (e.g., the game screen) to draw on.
            sx (int): X coordinate (in pixels) of the cell's top-left corner on the surface.
            sy (int): Y coordinate (in pixels) of the cell's top-left corner on the surface.
            color (tuple[int, int, int], optional): Initial fill color (RGB). Defaults to consts.back_color.

        Behavior:
            - Stores position (sx, sy), size (from consts.cell_size), surface, and color.
            - Draws a 1-pixel black border rectangle for the cellâ€™s outline.
            - Fills the interior of the cell with the initial color via set_color().

        """
        Fill the cell's interior (inside the border) with the given color and update the display.

        Why the +1 and -2 offsets?
            - We drew a 1-pixel border for the cell at (sx, sy) with size (size, size).
            - To avoid painting over that border, we inset the fill rectangle by 1 pixel on each side:
                * left/top starts at (sx + 1, sy + 1)
                * width/height are reduced by 2 (1 px from each side): (size - 2, size - 2)
            - This preserves the border and cleanly fills the inner area only.

            color (tuple[int, int, int]): New fill color (RGB).

        self.color = color

        # Draw the inner (filled) rectangle, inset by 1 px on all sides to preserve the border.
