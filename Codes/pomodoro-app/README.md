# Pomodoro Timer

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer application built with Python and `tkinter`. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This app helps you track your work and break sessions with a visual timer and tomato emojis to mark completed work sessions.

## Features
- **Work Timer**: 25-minute work sessions (customizable).
- **Short Break**: 5-minute breaks after each work session.
- **Long Break**: 20-minute break after 4 work sessions.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays a tomato image and updates the timer in real-time.
- **Progress Tracking**: Adds a tomato emoji (`üçÖ`) for every completed work session.
- **Reset Functionality**: Reset the timer and progress at any time.

## Prerequisites
To run this application, you'll need:
- **Python 3.6+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **tkinter**: Comes pre-installed with Python (no additional installation needed).
- **emoji**: A Python library to render emoji characters.
