## Objective
Create an automated bot that uses Selenium and Python to interact with Tinder's web interface and perform automatic swiping actions.
- The bot logs in to [Tinder](https://tinder.com/) using Facebook credentials.
- It continuously swipes right on profiles to maximize match potential.
- When a match occurs, it detects and dismisses the popup to resume swiping.
- The bot respects Tinder's daily swipe limit and is intended for learning browser automation.

This project explores real-world use cases for Selenium by automating a popular web app in a fun and engaging way.
