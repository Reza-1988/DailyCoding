This project is part of the [100 Days of Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.

## Objective
Create an automated bot that uses Selenium and Python to interact with Tinder's web interface and perform automatic swiping actions.
- The bot logs in to [Tinder](https://tinder.com/) using Facebook credentials.
- It continuously swipes right on profiles to maximize match potential.
- When a match occurs, it detects and dismisses the popup to resume swiping.
- The bot respects Tinder's daily swipe limit and is intended for learning browser automation.

This project explores real-world use cases for Selenium by automating a popular web app in a fun and engaging way.

## üë∫ Challenge
1. **Create a New Account**
    1. If you don't have a Tinder account, set one up now. Make sure you can sign in to your account using Facebook or Google.
       - If you don't want to use your own details, set up a new Facebook account and use an AI-generated image from https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/
         - HINT: You can hit refresh on thispersondoesnotexist to generate new random images.
    2. Manually go through the process of swiping on profiles and see which elements you'll need to target with your code.
   - NOTE: If you don't want to disappoint anyone, you can always complete the tutorial and hit "NOPE" on everyone.
